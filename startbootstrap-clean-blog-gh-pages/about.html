                        <p>Whether you call it “soccer” or “football”
                            , at some
                            point in your life you’ve been a player, a fan, or at
                            least a spectator of The Beautiful Game. With more
                            than 5 billion fans worldwide, soccer is the most
                            popular sport on the planet; but it is much more
                            than that. For example, just last year the US
                            Women’s National Soccer Team reached a
                            settlement that required equal pay for both male
                            and female soccer players in all competitions,
                            which marked a milestone towards gender equality
                            worldwide.</p>
                        <p>Soccer is more than just 22 people running behind
                            a ball. As Liverpool’s former coach Bill Shankly, once
                            said: “Some people believe football is a matter of
                            life and death. I am very disappointed with that
                            attitude. I can assure you it is much, much more
                            than that.
                            ” Throughout the course of history,
                            soccer has been used as an instrument to promote
                            social change, a political weapon, a multi-billion-
                            dollar revenue industry, and a tool for mass
                            mobilization. And in the last century, FIFA, the
                            international governing body of the sport, has
                            overseen this world-changing endeavor.</p>
                        <p>FIFA, or the Fédération Internationale de Football
                            Association, was founded in 1904 and is
                            headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland. Its primary
                            role is to regulate and promote soccer on a global
                            scale. FIFA's responsibilities include organizing
                            major international tournaments such as the FIFA
                            World Cup, which is the most prestigious event in
                            soccer. Additionally, FIFA sets and enforces the
                            rules of the game, manages the transfer of players
                            between clubs and countries, and works to develop
                            and grow soccer at all levels, from grassroots
                            initiatives to professional leagues.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, FIFA plays a crucial role in shaping
                            the socio-economic landscape of soccer by
                            negotiating broadcasting rights, sponsorship
                            deals, and revenue distribution among its
                            member associations. As the governing body of
                            the world's most popular sport, FIFA wields
                            significant influence over the development,
                            governance, and commercialization of soccer,
                            making it a central figure in the global sporting
                            landscape.</p>

                                HISTORY</h4>
                        <p>Throughout history, soccer has been used to
                            promote distinct political ideals around the
                            world. According to Simon Martin, a political
                            anthropologist from the University of London,
                            Mussolini used the Italian national team to
                            showcase the strength and power of fascism.
                            Italy hosted the 1934 World Cup and took
                            advantage of the tourism and media attention to
                            display the country’s prowess and style during
                            the fascist governance.</p>
                        <p>Simon claimed that Italy’s victories of both the
                            1934 and 1938 World Cups demonstrated
                            fascism's dominance and its reshaping of football
                            to serve as a propaganda tool, influencing public
                            opinion, infiltrating daily life, and constructing a
                            national identity aligned with the regime's ideals.
                            By strategically leveraging the sport's popularity
                            and success on the international stage,
                            authorities can influence public opinion,
                            reinforce ideological narratives, and even display
                            dominance over their political enemies. The use
                            of soccer as a display of dominance was seen
                            almost at the same time as Mussolini’s regime,
                            during the Spanish Revolution.</p>
                            <pv>In 1936, General Francisco Franco used the capital’s
                                soccer team, Real Madrid, to show dominance over
                                the Basque, Catalan, and Galician provinces. Real
                                Madrid dominated the league for several years. By
                                signing the best players in the world, they came on
                                top of Athletic Club Bilbao, F.C Barcelona and R.C
                                Celta de Vigo (the most important teams of said
                                provinces), amongst others.</pv>
                            <pv>By investing in soccer infrastructure and talent
                                development, and by gaining national and
                                international success, governments can project
                                strength and power, potentially undermining
                                political adversaries and bolstering their own
                                geopolitical standing.</pv>

                            <pv>A country’s geopolitical standing depends largely on
                                its depiction in the media. For example, in 1978
                                Argentina hosted and used the World Cup as a
                                mean of diverting attention from its oppressive
                                military regime and the atrocities committed during
                                the Dirty War. Despite international calls for
                                boycotts due to human rights abuses by Argentinian
                                dictator Jorge Videla’s regime, the Argentinian
                                government saw the tournament as an opportunity
                                to bolster its legitimacy and image. According to
                                Ken Rushworth, a researcher from the University of
                                Manchester, Argentina went so far as to create
                                temporal concentration camps for the regime’s
                                political opponents, and to clear impoverished
                                neighborhoods located near stadiums to keep them
                                hidden from the media.</pv>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                            <pv>In addition, Argentina allegedly interfered in
                                matches, all while the regime suppressed dissent
                                and perpetrated violence. Ultimately, the World
                                Cup served as a propaganda tool for the
                                dictatorship, showcasing a facade of unity and
                                celebration while atrocities continued unchecked,
                                highlighting the exploitation of soccer for political
                                gain. This instances of political corruption and
                                violence in the World Cup have decreased –
                                although not disappeared – over the years, but the
                                tournament’s influence in global economics has
                                only increased.</pv>

                                    123.4 million viewers. The World Cup Final had 15
                                    times more viewers than the most watched
                                    broadcast in US history. In other words, more than

                                    the game at the same time.</pv>

                                    possesses an unparalleled potential to shape

                                    consumer reach. Publicity campaigns can also
                                    transcend borders, reaching every corner of the
                                    world simultaneously and creating unprecedented

                                    broadcast could influence public opinion and

                                        billion people cannot be overstated; it has the
                                        power to reshape societal norms, alter cultural
                                        perceptions, and drive significant shifts in global
                                        attitudes and behaviors. A broadcast of this
                                        magnitude not only serves as an information
                                        platform but also as a catalyst for societal
                                        change. The influence that such a tournament
                                        could have in society was recognized by diverse
                                        human rights organizations, who heavily
                                        criticized FIFA for awarding the tournament’s

                                        as a weapon of soft power, a multi-billion-dollar
                                        industry, and a platform for mass mobilization.
                                        Soccer, through the stewardship of FIFA, serves as
                                        more than just a game; it is a lens through which we
                                        can understand and address broader socio-
